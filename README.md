# Applied-Finite-Element-Methods
The aim of this project is to study the Prey-Predator dynamics, modeled by partial differential equations. 
The project is divided into three parts. Part A examines a simpler one-dimensional stationary diffusion problem of the Prey-Predator model and part B a two-dimensional time-dependent reaction-diffusion equation. In part C, finally the system of the Prey-Predator model is being solved, using the open-source software FEniCS Project.
